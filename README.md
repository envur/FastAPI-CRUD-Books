# Welcome!

<p>This is a small project that I made at work to train basic VueJS, FastAPI and general API creation skills. It's a platform to register books by users. The base comes from the amazing TestDriven.io tutorial: https://testdriven.io/blog/developing-a-single-page-app-with-flask-and-vuejs/.</p>

## Make sure to read the README files inside the directories to install and run the project.

### The client directory contains all the Front-end codes.
### The server directory contains all the Back-end codes.
